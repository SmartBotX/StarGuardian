# Get Started

The following things are required:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or any editor you want
- [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/)

Now Let's get into the real deal, Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/) and create a new application.

once you created your application make sure to get the following things [Bot's Token, Application ID, and Invite Link] your can create your invite link in the OAuth panel> URL Generator

make sure to select Bot as you are using the application for a "BOT". Next Select the permission you want to use, NEVER USE ADMINISTRATORR!

My default choice are these since it doesn't join a call nor does it have any moderator tools. Okay, once everything is selected you should be able to see a link underneath that selections. Make sure to copy that link and paste it in the ```INVLINK``` That is found in ```./handlers/config.json/```.

**Moving Forward!**

Next step is to create a file called ```.env``` this is where we store our important keys (Bot's Token, Application ID, ChannelID, GuildID). Once created head over to your developer portal and create a bot.

just click on the "add bot" to then name it whatever you want below that you should be able to copy your ```Token```. Paste that token to your ENV file

sample code:
```
TOKEN=IOPAJDSFOAGDFOUGHNLBVILUH1235634OIUJDFG
chid=1234537685697585
appid=23145264578458613
guid=234534637316345
```
For AppID you should be able to get that from ```General Information> ApplicationID``` from Discord Developer Portal

For Channel ID ```chid``` you'll be able to get that by enabling Developer Mode which is found in ```Discord App User Settings> Advanced> Developer Mode``` afterwards exit from settings and right click on a specific channel you wan't to use. Then press CopyID and that should copy your ```chid```

for GuildID ```guid``` right click on your server icon the one on the left side selector then click CopyID and that should copy your ```guid```

all of these are needed to be able to make the bot run.

**Final Steps**

You are almost at the end! all you need to do is run the ```npm install``` (one time command) command first to install all the necessary node_modules then run ```comdep.js``` (bot / command only works on selected GUILD) or ```comdepGlobal.js``` (Global Command) once you managed to run it just run index.js and your bot should start!

```
Command Fist Time Install (if newley downloaded)
npm install
node comdep.js or comdepGlobal.js
node index.js
```

```
Command (bot / command only works on selected GUILD)
node comdep.js 
node index.js
```
```
Command (bot / command works Global)
node comdepGlobal.js 
node index.js
```
